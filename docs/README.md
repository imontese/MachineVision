Machine Vision Application using PLC
 
Welcome to this machine vision application using PLC. In this project, we will create a machine vision engine from scratch using Python and OpenCV, the famous library for image processing. The aim is to create a small vision engine that can be connected to your PLC and your machine without spending a fortune on expensive equipment and software.
Project Overview
 
Our project is a bottle labeling quality control system. In chemical factories, it's vital to have a label on every single bottle, containing important information like expiration date and instructions. We will create a program that checks the label on every bottle, allowing it to pass if the label is present and rejecting it if not.
Requirements
 

PLC (any brand that supports communication protocols)
Mini PC (to run image processing algorithms)
Camera (webcam or budget industrial camera)

In this project, we will not be buying any equipment. Instead, we will emulate everything on our laptops.
Emulation
 

Codesys Runtime: Free 2-hour PLC emulator with OPC UA support
Python: Free programming language and libraries
Camera: Standstill pictures in a directory to act as the camera
Sensors and actuators: Emulate signals and actions using the PLC emulator

We will also create a small GUI for the PLC using Codesys to control the system.
Getting Started
 

Install the Codesys Runtime and set up the PLC emulator with OPC UA support.
Install Python and the necessary libraries (e.g., OpenCV).
Prepare a directory with standstill pictures to act as the camera.
Emulate sensors and actuators using the PLC emulator.
Create a GUI for the PLC using Codesys.

With these steps completed, you'll be ready to start developing your own machine vision engines and experimenting with different applications.

As the project progresses, we'll dive deeper into the concepts and implementation, refining our machine vision system and exploring its full potential.
